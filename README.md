# Software Development Practices - Staff Graded Assessment 2

This file provides an overview of the two-part assignment.

* **Part 1** involved creating a simple HTML website, tracking it with Git, and pushing it to this GitHub repository.
* **Part 2** involved creating a simple Python application and containerizing it with Docker, then pushing the image to Docker Hub.

## Part 1: Git & GitHub Project (This Repository)

* **Project Overview:** A simple two-page HTML web application created to demonstrate a standard Git workflow (init, add, commit, branch, switch, push).

## Part 2: Docker & Docker Hub Project

* **Project Overview:** A simple Python script that prints a "Hello World" message. This script was packaged into a lightweight Docker image using a `Dockerfile` and based on the `python:3.9-slim` base image.
